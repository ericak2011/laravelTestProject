Create a Laravel web application to support the following objectives.

·  Allow a CSV file to be selected, assume the first row is the header and ensure there are at least 3 columns but no more than 10

·  Process the file contents display it in a grid

·  If an error occurs or the file is invalid, display an error message that the user will understand

·  For the column headers, display the name and data type in the column

·  Once visible, have a button to add a new column that combines the values of first and third columns and add it to the end of the table. If the value ends up being whitespace or zero, display the text "[EMPTY]"
